To run tests with the professional version of nexus, we had the problem, that the professional version is not available as deployable WAR.

That's why we build a WAR out of the professional version bundle:
- copy libs to WEB-INF/libs
- copy plugins to WEB-INF/runtime/...
- copy plexus.xml,plexus.properties,jetty.xml to WEB-INF/
- comment out all JettyServletContainer-Stuff in plexus.xml
